# Weathertop: Find My Weather

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Simple web application to find the current weather in a queried city.
Allows users to return data in imperial or metric systems; but defaults to kelvin if no option is selected.
